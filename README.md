# VDLIB

VDLIB is an open source library for simulating grain growth. It is based on  [SCOREC](https://github.com/SCOREC/core), a massively parallelizable open source finite element library developed by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The long term goal of VDLIB is modeling general microstructure evolution by inclusion of additional physics such as crystal plasticity. The user communicates with the objects of the vd_sim class through input files for specifying equations of motion, time integration scheme, and information to extract from the simulation. Example programs are provided in [Link to the VDtrials repo](https://www.google.com).
